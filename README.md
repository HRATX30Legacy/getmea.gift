# üéÅ GetMeA.Gift

Starter project to easily bootstrap a React app served up with Express. Also uses [custom-react-scripts](https://github.com/kitze/custom-react-scripts) to add optional support for ES6 decorators, SASS/SCSS, LESS, Stylus, & CSS modules without needing to eject out of Create React App.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes. See Deployment for notes on how to deploy the project to Heroku.

## Installing

Install all dependencies with one command.
```
npm run setup
```

## Running for development

This will start the client at http://localhost:3000 which will proxy the api server that is running at http://localhost:3001. The proxy will allow you to make ajax requests to a relative url (such as '/api/hello') from the client and it will route that request to the api server. This proxy only runs during development.
```
npm start
```
